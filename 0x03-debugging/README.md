ou are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task 

#0 to compile with this main file to test locally.                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                                                         

                                                                                                                                                         

Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
